### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URLs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming schema (e.g. **http://**).

Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemas specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web source that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechainism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeable. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (**http**), but are also used for file transfer (**ftp**), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form *http://www.example.com/index.html*, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).
