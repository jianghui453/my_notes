## Partial Dependency

A Partial Functional Dependency is when you have a Composite Primary Key (a primary key that is made up of multiple columns), and one of the non-key columns is functionally dependent on one, but not all of the columns that make up the Composite Primary Key. 

## Transitive Dependency

A Transitive Dependency is when you have a column that is functionally dependent on a column that is not the primary key.
