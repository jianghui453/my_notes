### Physical layer

The Physical layer is also called as the Layer 1. Here are the basic functionalities of the Physical layer:
1. Responsible for electical signals, light signal, radio signals etc.
1. Hardware layer of the OSI layer
1. Devices like repeater, hub, cables, ethernet work on this layer
1. Protocols like RS232, ATM, FDDI, Ethernet work on this layer

### Data Link layer

Thie data link layer is also called as the Layer 2 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the data link layer:
1. The set of data on this layer called Frame
1. Responsibel for encoding and decoding of the electrical signals into bits.
1. Manages data errors from the physical layer
1. Convers electical signals into frames
1. The data link layer is divide into two sub-layers
    1. The Media Access Control(MAC) layer
    1. Logical Link Control(LLC) layer
1. The MAC sublayer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and  permission to transmit it
1. The LLC layer controls frame synchronization, flow control and error checking
1. MAC address is a part of the layer 2
1. Devices like Switch work as this layer

### Network layer

The Network layer is also called as the layer 3 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the network layer:
1. The set of data on this layer called Packet
1. Switching and routing technologies work here
1. Creates logical paths between two hosts across the world wide web called as virtual circuits
1. Routes the data packet to destination
1. Routing and forwarding of the data packets
1. Internetworking, error, handling, congestion control and packet sequencing work at this layer
1. Router works at layer three
1. Different network protocols like TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk work at this layer

### Transport layer

The Transport layer is also called as the layer 4 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the Transport layer:
1. The set of data on this layer called segment
1. Responsible for the transparent transfer of data between end systems
1. Responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control
1. Responsible for complete data transfer
1. Protocols like SPX, TCP, UDP work here

### Session layer

The Session layer is also called as the layer 5 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the Session layer:
1. Responsibele for establishment, management and termination of connections between applicatins
1. The session layer sets up, coordinates ans terminates conversations, exchangees, and dialogues between the applications at each end
1. It deals with session and connection coordination
1. Protocols like NFS,  NetBios names, RPC, SQL, SSl work at this layer

### Presentation layer

The Presentation layer is also called as the layer 6 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the presentation layer:
1. Responsible for data representation on your screen
1. Encrytion and decryption of the data
1. Data Semantics and syntax
1. Layer 6 Presentation examples include encryption, ASCII, EBCDIC, TIFF, GIF, PICT, JPEG, MPEG, MIDI

### Application Layer

The Application layer is also called ad the layer 7 of the OSI model. Here are the basic functionalities of the Application layer:
1. Application layer supports application, apps, and end-user processes
1. Quality of service
1. This layer is responsible for application services for file transfer, e-mail, and other network software services
1. Protocols like Telnet, SSH, FTP, HTTP work on this layer
